# Using CNN's with the Cats vs Dogs Dataset

 In this notebook, I will be using the famous `Cats vs Dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. I will create a Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities.

I will also create some helper functions to move the images around the filesystem so if you are not familiar with the `os` module be sure to take a look a the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).

Let's get started!
